# **🎓 AI & Data Science Portfolio – David Khachatryan**

Welcome to my **AI & Data Science Portfolio**, a curated collection of my projects, research notebooks, and experiments in **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Analysis**.  
This repository showcases my academic journey, technical growth, and applied work in data-driven problem-solving.

## **🧭 About This Portfolio**

This portfolio was created to demonstrate both **theoretical understanding** and **practical implementation** of key AI and ML concepts.  
Every notebook has been designed to reflect real analytical thinking — from data exploration and mathematical modeling to algorithm evaluation and interpretation.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Build a professional foundation in **AI and Data Science** through applied research.  
- Explore the mathematics behind algorithms and their real-world impact.  
- Develop reproducible, transparent, and well-documented projects.  
- Share insights, visualizations, and code for learning and collaboration.

## **🗂️ Repository Structure**

Each folder represents a project or concept area.  
All projects include a Jupyter Notebook and a local `README.md` with an introduction, explanation, and conclusions.

**Main sections:**
- `Exploratory_Data_Analysis/` → Data exploration, visualization, and insights.  
- `Regression_Models/` → Linear, Multiple, and Logistic Regression.  
- `Classification_Algorithms/` → KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests.  
- `Ensemble_Learning/` → Bagging, Boosting, and Gradient-based ensembles.  
- `Optimization_Methods/` → Gradient Descent, Adam, Momentum, Newton.  
- `Bayesian_Thinking/` → MLE, MAP, Prior & Posterior probability reasoning.  
- `Unsupervised_Learning/` → K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA.  

Each project is structured as a complete analysis:
1. **Problem Definition**  
2. **Theoretical Overview**  
3. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
4. **Model Development**  
5. **Evaluation & Interpretation**  
6. **Conclusion & Key Takeaways**

## **🧠 Philosophy**

I believe that Artificial Intelligence is not just about automation — it’s about **understanding intelligence itself**.  
Through mathematical rigor, experimentation, and continuous learning, I strive to build systems that **learn, reason, and make decisions intelligently**.  
This portfolio represents that journey: one project at a time.
